{"situation_view_id":"5","situation_view_name":"South Sudan","situation_view_description":"The situation in South Sudan and neighbouring countries has quickly escalated into a full-blown humanitarian emergency. \r\nThe majority of the refugees are women and children, many of whom flee across the border alone. Often, they arrive weak and malnourished. When the rainy season comes, their needs are compounded by flooding, food shortages and disease.\r\nInside South Sudan, nearly two million people are displaced internally, while outside the country there are now over two million South Sudanese refugees, mainly in Ethiopia, Sudan, and Uganda. Many fear imminent attack or struggle with food insecurity. Uganda currently hosts the most South Sudanese refugees, having taken in more than one million.","data":[{"geomaster_name":"Turkana","geomaster_id":6163,"admin_level":"District","centroid_lon":"35.6207049","centroid_lat":"3.0398871","lat_max":5.4253357903935,"lon_max":38.57773615,"lat_min":0.73885827173606,"lon_min":33.6744158375,"source":"UNHCR","date":"2018-10-31","month":"10","year":"2018","population_groups_concat":"Registered refugees from South Sudan  (refugee camps\/centers, UNHCR)","population_group_id":"4949","individuals_type":"2","demography_type":"1","individuals":"107672","households":"22632","population_groups":[{"id":"4949","name":"Registered refugees from South Sudan  (refugee camps\/centers, UNHCR)","pop_accommodation_code":"C","pop_accommodation_name":"Refugee Camps\/Centers","pop_data_type_code":"REG","pop_data_type_name":"Registered","pop_type_code":"REF","pop_type_name":"Refugees","pop_frequency_name":"Daily","pop_frequency_code":"D","pop_frequency_cumulative":"cumulative","pop_frequency_cumulative_code":"C","pop_origin_name":"South Sudan","pop_origin_code":"SSD"}],"published":false,"numChildren":"0","color":"#3c8dbc"},{"geomaster_name":"Nairobi","geomaster_id":1868,"admin_level":"Province","centroid_lon":"36.8233","centroid_lat":"-1.29147","lat_max":-0.85042175201124,"lon_max":37.383938427734,"lat_min":-1.6365324708332,"lon_min":36.180264111328,"source":"UNHCR","date":"2018-08-31","month":"8","year":"2018","population_groups_concat":"Registered refugees from South Sudan  (refugee camps\/centers, UNHCR)","population_group_id":"4949","individuals_type":"2","demography_type":"1","individuals":"5763","households":"2500","population_groups":[{"id":"4949","name":"Registered refugees from South Sudan  (refugee camps\/centers, UNHCR)","pop_accommodation_code":"C","pop_accommodation_name":"Refugee Camps\/Centers","pop_data_type_code":"REG","pop_data_type_name":"Registered","pop_type_code":"REF","pop_type_name":"Refugees","pop_frequency_name":"Daily","pop_frequency_code":"D","pop_frequency_cumulative":"cumulative","pop_frequency_cumulative_code":"C","pop_origin_name":"South Sudan","pop_origin_code":"SSD"}],"published":false,"numChildren":"0","color":"#3c8dbc"},{"geomaster_name":"Garissa","geomaster_id":6162,"admin_level":"Province","centroid_lon":"39.6460988","centroid_lat":"-0.4532293","lat_max":2.9123472600325,"lon_max":42.8228566125,"lat_min":-2.0246985960768,"lon_min":37.9634816125,"source":"UNHCR","date":"2018-08-31","month":"8","year":"2018","population_groups_concat":"Registered refugees from South Sudan  (refugee camps\/centers, UNHCR)","population_group_id":"4949","individuals_type":"2","demography_type":"1","individuals":"956","households":"280","population_groups":[{"id":"4949","name":"Registered refugees from South Sudan  (refugee camps\/centers, UNHCR)","pop_accommodation_code":"C","pop_accommodation_name":"Refugee Camps\/Centers","pop_data_type_code":"REG","pop_data_type_name":"Registered","pop_type_code":"REF","pop_type_name":"Refugees","pop_frequency_name":"Daily","pop_frequency_code":"D","pop_frequency_cumulative":"cumulative","pop_frequency_cumulative_code":"C","pop_origin_name":"South Sudan","pop_origin_code":"SSD"}],"published":false,"numChildren":"0","color":"#3c8dbc"}],"title_language_ar":"","title_language_en":"Breakdown by County","title_language_es":"","title_language_fr":"","subtitle_language_ar":"","subtitle_language_en":"","subtitle_language_es":"","subtitle_language_fr":"","limit":"","color":"#3c8dbc","frequency":"day","chartType":"areaspline"}
